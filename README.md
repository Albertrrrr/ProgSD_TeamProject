UofG ProgSD TeamProject
## Introduction
This project is to create a software system to support an electric vehicle share programme.
We use Python for our implementation, with a user interface written in Tkinter.
Additionally, we set the database which is MySQL on Google Cloud to support our project.

## Update Bate 1.0
- improve security, you just need to change mysql_config from `config.py` only
- improve support for other building platform, in particular macOS 
- improve user friendliness 

## Environment Preparation 
### Install Anaconda Environment
`conda create -n projectBike python=3.6`

`conda activate projectBike`
### Install packages 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Notice important package
- numpy version > 1.20.0
- tensorflow version > 2.6.0
- when you use MacOS, you might need to install ttk or tkmacos to instead tkinter

`pip install tkmacos`
## Database Preparation
You can download our data and structure to import your local or online service.  

We recommend the following software to load the databaseï¼š
- Navicat
- Datagrip

## Run
### app.py 
This is the back-end system back-end system integration, which contains a number of test cases and calls to methods in the `__main__` function.  

### run.py 
This is the root file to start the project, run `run.py` to start the project.  

### Notice
- When you run before, please be sure to complete the environment configuration and database configuration has been changed, otherwise you are still running the data used by our project.  

- You have to change the `mysql_config` in `config.py`

### Test
Once you have successfully run it, you can register your own account to complete the test
